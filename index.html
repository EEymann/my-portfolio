    <h1>Hello! My name is Liz Eymann.</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by! Here you can check out all the cool projects I have been working on in my intro-to-programming class at Epicodus:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Hello World.<p>This is the <em>very first</em> webpage I learned how to make! I only used <strong>HTML</strong> to make it, so it's super basic, but I thought it was pretty cool because I learned how to make <strong>header tags</strong>, which introduce the webpage to the visitor. I learned that the text in an <strong>h1 tag</strong> will stand out the most because it is large. Then, to add more information to compliment the header, we can add an <strong>h2 tag</strong>, which will be a little smaller than the <strong>h1 tag</strong>. I also learned about <strong>p tags</strong>, which allow us to write paragraphs, like this one. Finally, I learned about <strong>ordered and unordered lists</strong>, which create nice bullet points or numbers to a list of items, like this list of my projects. Pretty neat!</p></li>
        <li>My first webpage.<p>Wow! Now things get much more interesting! This is because I used both <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. First off, adding images to my webpage draws in the audience. Who can't resist the cute picture of my furry rommate, Toast? I learned how to emphasize snippits of text with something called <strong>inline styling</strong>. For example, I learned about the <strong>strong tag</strong>, which makes text bold! I also learned some basic styling techniques with CSS, like centering my header, and changing the color and font of my text! The coolest part of this web page are the links, which I learned how to make with <strong>href attributes</strong>! Be sure to check out these two cool links: 
          <ul><li><a href="index.html"> my favorite things</a></li><li><a href="favorite-places.html"> my favorite places</a>.</p></li></ul>
        <li>A boring lecture about dirt.<p> This website uses <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. Rest assured, it isn't as <em>boring</em> as it sounds if you can appreciate the cool CSS rules I learned to style my heading, text, and images! Here I applied CSS classes to change the appearance of my text, headers, and images. First, notice the cool background colors on the headers, which proudly boast a larger text size! Don't overlook the oval shaped image, which I created using a border-radius.</p></li>
        <li>It's a dog's blog.<p>This simple, yet fun blog is written with HTML and CSS. I used <strong>divs</strong> and <strong>spans</strong> to style my text, making important items stand out with distinct colors!</p></li>
        <li>My favorite band.<p>This webpage showcases my favorite musician, Julieta Venegas. It is written with HTML and CSS. With the magic of the <strong>box model</strong> and <strong>floats</strong> in CSS, I created a sidebar to list Julieta's upcoming shows.</p></li>
        <li>Four Paws Animal shelter.<p>This webpage, written with HTML and CSS, shows off some of the cool tricks you can achieve with CSS! Here I used classes to create <strong>columns</strong>, and with the idea of <strong>cascading</strong>, I added fun background colors and font to my paragraphs about all the adorable dogs available for adoption at the shelter. Don't miss the responsive design I implemented by using <strong>media queries</strong>. To check it out for yourself, resize your screen and you'll notice the background color changes from white to teal!</p></li>
        <li>My Dream Vacation<p>This webpage is written using HTML and the power of <strong>bootsrap</strong>. Here you can learn about <em>The Fiji Islands</em>, a dream vacation destination of mine! Bootstrap allowed me to add in some pretty awesome features to my page, such as a <strong>container</strong>, to pad all content; a <strong>Jumbotron</strong>, to make my title stand out; <strong>blockquotes</strong>, to display quotes from previous tourists in the area; and <strong>helper classes</strong>, to highlight important information. Notice the responsive design? That's all thanks to bootstrap!</p></li>
