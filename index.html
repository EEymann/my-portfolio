    <h1>Hello! My name is Liz Eymann.</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by! Here you can check out all the cool projects I have been working on in my intro-to-programming class at Epicodus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hello World.<p>This is the <em>very first</em> webpage I learned how to make! I only used HTML to make it, so it's super basic, but I thought it was pretty cool because I learned how to make header tags, which introduce the webpage to the visitor. I learned that the text in an h1 tag will stand out the most because it is large. Then, if we want to add more information to compliment the header, we can add an h2 tag, which will be a little smaller than the h1 tag. I also learned about p tags, which allow us to write paragraphs, like this one. Finally, I learned about unordered lists, which create nice bullet points to a list of items, like this list of my projects. Pretty neat!</p></li>
        <li>My first webpage.<p>Wow! Now things get much more interesting! This is because I used both HTML and CSS. First off, adding images to my webpage draws in the audience. Who can't resist this cute picture of my furry rommate, Toast? ____ I learned how to emphasize snippits of text with something called <strong>inline styling</strong>. For example, I learned about the <strong>strong tag</strong>, which makes text bold! I also learned some basic styling techniques with CSS, like centering my header, and changing the color and font of my text! The coolest part of this web page are the links, which I learned how to make with <strong>href attributes</strong>! On my first webpage, be sure to check out <a href="index.html"> my favorite things</a> and <a href="favorite-places.html"> my favorite places</a>.</p></li>
        <li>A boring lecture about dirt.<p> This website uses CSS and HTML. Rest assured, it isn't as <em>boring</em> as it sounds if you can appreciate the cool CSS rules I learned to style my heading, text, and images! Here I applied CSS classes to change the appearance of my text, headers, and images. First, notice the cool background colors on the headers, which proudly boast a larger text size! Don't overlook the oval shaped image, which I created using a border-radius.</p></li>
