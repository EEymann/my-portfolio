     <h1>Hello! My name is Liz. Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
   </div>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by! Here you can check out all the cool projects I have been working on in my intro-to-programming class at Epicodus:</p>
          <ol> 
            <li>My first webpage</li>
              <p>Like the title says, this is <em>my very first</em> webpage! I created this page using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. Here I learned how to add pictures (cute cat alert!). I also learned how to emphasize snippits of text with something called <strong>inline styling</strong>. For example, the <strong>strong tag</strong>, makes text bold! I implemented some CSS to center my header, and change the color and font of my text! The coolest part of this web page are the links, which I learned how to make with <strong>href attributes</strong>! Be sure to check out these two cool links: 
                <ul><li><a href="favorite-things.html"> my favorite things</a></li>
                  <li><a href="favorite-places.html"> my favorite places</a></p></li></ul>
                    <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/boring-lecture/"> A Boring Lecture About Dirt</a></p>
                      <p>This website uses <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. Rest assured, it isn't as <em>boring</em> as it sounds if you can appreciate the cool CSS rules I learned to style my heading, text, and images! Here I applied CSS classes to change the appearance of my text, headers, and images. First, notice the cool background colors on the headers, which proudly boast a larger text size! Don't overlook the oval shaped image, which I created using a border-radius.</p></li>
                        <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/blog-website/">It's a Dog's Blog</li></a>
                          <p>This simple, yet fun blog is written with HTML and CSS. I used <strong>divs</strong> and <strong>spans</strong> to style my text, making important items stand out with distinct colors!</p>
                            <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/favorite-band/">My Favorite Band</li></a>
                              <p>This webpage showcases my favorite musician, Julieta Venegas. It is written with HTML and CSS. With the magic of the <strong>box model</strong> and <strong>floats</strong> in CSS, I created a sidebar to list Julieta's upcoming shows.</p>
                                <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/shelter/">Four Paws Animal shelter</li></a>
                                  <p>This webpage, written with HTML and CSS, shows off some of the cool tricks you can achieve with CSS! Here I used classes to create <strong>columns</strong>, and with the idea of <strong>cascading</strong>, I added fun background colors and font to my paragraphs about all the adorable dogs available for adoption at the shelter. Don't miss the responsive design I implemented by using <strong>media queries</strong>. To check it out for yourself, resize your screen and you'll notice the background color changes from white to teal!</p>
                                    <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/vacation-site/">My Dream Vacation</li></a>
                                      <p>This webpage is written using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>and <strong>bootsrap</strong>. Here you can learn about <em>The Fiji Islands</em>, a dream vacation destination of mine! Bootstrap allowed me to add in some pretty awesome features to my page, such as a <strong>container</strong>, to pad all content; a <strong>Jumbotron</strong>, to make my title stand out; <strong>blockquotes</strong>, to display quotes from previous tourists in the area; and <strong>helper classes</strong>, to highlight important information. Notice the responsive design? That's all thanks to bootstrap!</p>
