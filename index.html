    <h1>Hello! My name is Liz. Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    Thanks for stopping by! Here you can check out all the cool projects I have been working on in my
    intro-to-programming class at Epicodus:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://eeymann.github.io/my-first-webpage/">My first webpage</a>
    </li>
    <p>Like the title says, this is <em>my very first</em> webpage! I created this webpage using <strong>HTML</strong> and
      <strong>CSS</strong>. Here I learned how to add pictures (cute cat alert!). I also learned how to emphasize snippits of text with something called <strong>inline styling</strong>. For example, the <strong>strong
          tag</strong>, makes text bold! I implemented some CSS to center my header, and change the color and font of my
        text! The coolest part of this web page are the links, which I learned how to make with <strong>href
          attributes</strong>! Be sure to check out these two cool links:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/my-first-webpage/favorite-things.html"> my favorite things</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/my-first-webpage/favorite-places.html"> my favorite places</a></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <li>
      <a href="https://eeymann.github.io/boring-lecture/"> A Boring Lecture About Dirt</a>
      <p>This webpage uses <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. Rest assured, it isn't as <em>boring</em> as
        it sounds if you can appreciate the cool CSS classes I learned to style my heading, text, and images! First, notice the cool background
        colors on the headers, which proudly boast a larger text size! Don't overlook the oval shaped image, which I
        created using a border-radius.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/blog-website/">It's a Dog's Blog</li></a>
    <p>This simple, yet fun blog is written with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. I used <strong>divs</strong> and <strong>spans</strong>
      to style my text, making important items stand out with distinct colors!</p>
    <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/favorite-band/">My Favorite Band</li></a>
    <p>This webpage showcases my favorite musician, Julieta Venegas. It is written with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. With the magic of
      the <strong>box model</strong> and <strong>floats</strong> in CSS, I created a sidebar to list Julieta's upcoming
      shows.</p>
    <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/shelter/">Four Paws Animal shelter</li></a>
    <p>This webpage, written with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, shows off some of the cool tricks you can achieve with CSS! Here I used
      classes to create <strong>columns</strong>, and with the idea of <strong>cascading</strong>, I added fun
      background colors and font to my paragraphs about all the adorable dogs available for adoption at the shelter.
      Don't miss the responsive design I implemented by using <strong>media queries</strong>. To check it out for
      yourself, resize your screen and you'll notice the background color changes from white to teal!</p>
    <li><a href="https://eeymann.github.io/vacation-site/">My Dream Vacation</li></a>
    <p>This webpage is written using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>bootsrap</strong>. Here you
      can learn about <em>The Fiji Islands</em>, a dream vacation destination of mine! Bootstrap allowed me to add
      some pretty awesome features to my page, such as a <strong>container</strong>, to pad all content; a
      <strong>Jumbotron</strong>, to make my title stand out; <strong>blockquotes</strong>, to display quotes from
      previous tourists in the area; and <strong>helper classes</strong>, to highlight important information. Notice the
      responsive design? That's all thanks to bootstrap!</p>
